Bill calculator tech test for Good Energy

To run the application:

1. clone the repo
2. run yarn start in the terminal

The live site is at bill-calculator.dforder.com

In the initial 2 hours given to create the bill application, I focused on the brief being completed, making sure the functionality was working correctly with the scenarios provided, and including unit tests for each scenario. I spent 15 minutes at the beginning sketching ideas and layout options, and allowed 15 minutes at the end to set up hosting, building and deploying.

Retasked with making the application 'stand out', I added a game mode where you use the price of the groceries and the available deals to hit a goal price. This fills the criteria of the initial brief, but adds an extra element of my style to it!

I changed the layout to work better with the game I had in mind. However this new layout was designed more for a desktop than a mobile; I decided that adding the game features was more valuable for the task and displaying the whole game across a single phone screen would not fit the scope. I added routing with Reach Router to make navigation between the two modes simpler.

What I would work on next

1. The application would ideally have more unit testing, so the next thing I would do would be to learn more about unit testing (specifically in react), as this is something I only have a little experience with.

2. I would then work on better componentisation of the UI, making my components more reusable and generic where they can be. I would use a plugin like Storybook where I can see the components in isolation.
